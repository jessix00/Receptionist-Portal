# form1
The first sign in form I created using HTML MYSQL and PHP. 
This is a 3 part form, First the client signs in (index.html) The information is sent to the database using insert.php. 
The admin portion (disp.php) allows the user to display and edit (edit.php) the clients information. It also allows for the user to clock-out a visitor.(timeout.php)
If a visitor is clocked out, the information disapears from disp.php
