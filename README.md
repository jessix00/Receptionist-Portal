## How it Works
This project is devided in to three parts. 

1. index.html is meant to be client facing. The visitor will enter his/her information in this form. Once submitted, insert.php is used to push information to our database. 

2. disp.php is meant to only be accesed by the receptionist. This page displays anyone who is currently visiting the office. If an edit is needed, the receptionist can select the edit button which triggers edit.php page. If changes are made and saved, they will be pushed to our database. If a visitor leaves the office, the receptionist has access to sign them out. This removes them from the current visitors page.

3. search.php is also only meant to be accessed by the receptionist. In this page the receptionist can conduct searches based on selected column. search.php can be accessed via the disp.php page.
